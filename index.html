    <h1>Vaccination begins</h1>
    <br>
    <hr>

        Editorial | Published February 4, 2021

    
    <b>
        
            THE next phase in Pakistan’s fightback against the novel coronavirus has begun with appropriate fanfare.
            On
            Tuesday at the PM Office, in the presence of Prime Minister Imran Khan, anaesthetist and critical care
            specialist Prof Rana Imran Sikander became the first person in the country to be vaccinated against the
            disease.
        
    </b>
    <br><br>

    The first batch of Covid-19 vaccines, totalling half a million doses manufactured by Sinopharm, had arrived
        in
        Islamabad from Beijing on Monday, and the federal government dispatched the provinces their share from it
        the
        next day. Inoculation drives on a provincial level began yesterday. The National Command and Operation
        Centre
        deserves plaudits for the smooth start to the mammoth countrywide campaign. Judging by the detailed plan it
        has
        drawn up, considerable effort is being expended to ensure that vaccine procurement keeps up with the pace of
        inoculation, and a report in this paper yesterday quoted SAPM on Health Dr Faisal Sultan as saying he does
        not
        believe the supply side will pose a problem.
    <br><br>
    “We are more concerned about the demand side,” he said. The fear is that of the 70m of the adult population
        who
        should be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, as per health experts’ view, a considerable number — up to
        30m —
        may refuse it or opt out for one reason or another.
    <br><br>
    
        That is among several concerns in a situation where, at least to some extent, the authorities are flying
        blind.
        The novel coronavirus has been around for a little over a year. It is only recently that health
        professionals
        have got a handle on managing severe cases of Covid-19 to a certain extent, while the long-term and
        sometimes
        devastating implications of the disease are still being observed and understood.

        The immune system’s response to the vaccines, despite extensive human trials leading up to the approval
        stage, remains the subject of some debate. Consider that health authorities in France and Sweden have
        cleared AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine but advised against administering it to people over 65 years; that is
        at variance with the EU’s decision to approve the vaccine for adults of all ages. Meanwhile, a major UK
        study has confirmed that most people who have been infected with the coronavirus have antibodies in their
        blood for at least six months. Earlier, the consensus on viral immune response had considered three months
        as a minimum period during which one was highly unlikely to be reinfected.

    
    <br><br>
    One hopes that the government’s timeline regarding the procurement of the remaining batches of the vaccines
        is a realistic one. In the meantime it must prepare the Pakistani public about possible side effects of
        inoculation so that misinformation does not discourage people from registering. Further, regular updates
        with disaggregated data about those being inoculated will go a long way towards countering inevitable
        rumours about ‘elite’ individuals jumping the queue. Instilling trust in the transparency of the process is
        critical.
